# Security-in-Communication-Networks
This project implements a network security design for a simulated environment divided into three zones: Inside, Outside, and DMZ. It covers the network topology, the implementation of security policies, static routing and NAT configurations, and includes several exercises and a blocking rules script to demonstrate various network security aspects

## Project Overview
This project focuses on implementing a secure network topology with three main zones: **INSIDE**, **OUTSIDE**, and **DMZ**. The goal is to configure firewalls, load balancers, and routing rules to ensure secure communication between these zones while adhering to a defined security policy.

### Key Components
- **INSIDE Zone**: Represents the internal network with two subnets, including an administrative network.
- **OUTSIDE Zone**: Simulates the external internet, including a subnet for external devices and attackers.
- **DMZ Zone**: Contains servers accessible from both internal and external networks, including web servers and a DNS server.

## Network Topology
The network is divided into three zones:
1. **INSIDE**: Internal network with subnets for administrative and general use.
2. **OUTSIDE**: External network simulating the internet, including a subnet for attackers.
3. **DMZ**: Demilitarized zone with servers accessible from both internal and external networks.

## Security Policy
The implemented security policy allows:
- **INSIDE to DMZ**: ICMP, HTTP, HTTPS, SSH, and DNS for administrative users.
- **INSIDE to OUTSIDE**: UDP traffic on ports 5000-6000.
- **OUTSIDE to DMZ**: ICMP and HTTPS traffic, with specific IP blocking for attackers.
- **DMZ to INSIDE/OUTSIDE**: Established and related connections are allowed.

## Configuration Details
### Static Routes and NAT
- **Static Routes**: Configured on routers and load balancers to direct traffic between zones.
- **NAT**: Implemented on firewalls to translate internal IP addresses to a predefined range when traffic exits the network.

### Load Balancing
- **Sticky Connections**: Ensures that traffic between devices is always sent through the same connection.
- **IP Hash Algorithm**: Used to eliminate the need for synchronization between load balancers.

### Firewall Rules
- **INSIDE to DMZ**: Allows ICMP, HTTP, HTTPS, SSH, and DNS for specific IPs.
- **OUTSIDE to DMZ**: Allows ICMP and HTTPS, with IP-based blocking for attackers.
- **DMZ to INSIDE/OUTSIDE**: Allows established and related connections.

## Services
- **INSIDE to DMZ**: Ping (ICMP), HTTP, HTTPS, SSH, and DNS.
- **INSIDE to OUTSIDE**: UDP traffic on ports 5000-6000.
- **OUTSIDE to DMZ**: ICMP and HTTPS.

## Blocking Rules Script
A script is provided to automatically block traffic from identified attacker IPs. The script uses `tcpdump` to capture traffic and applies firewall rules to block malicious IPs.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Network Configuration**:
   - Configure the routers, load balancers, and firewalls as described in the project documentation.
   - Set up static routes and NAT rules on the firewalls.

2. **Load Balancers**:
   - Configure load balancers with sticky connections and the IP Hash algorithm to ensure traffic consistency.

3. **Firewall Rules**:
   - Apply the firewall rules as specified in the project documentation to enforce the security policy.

4. **Testing**:
   - Test the network by sending traffic between the INSIDE, OUTSIDE, and DMZ zones to ensure that the security policy is enforced.
   - Use the provided script to block traffic from attacker IPs and verify that the blocking rules are applied correctly.
